# 🏠 Student Room Reservation System

A Laravel-based web application that allows university students to reserve dorm rooms in a **queue-based system** with smart prioritization and confirmation flow.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The **Student Room Reservation System** manages room reservations in a structured and fair queue.  
Each student can reserve **one room as priority 1** and, if necessary, select a **backup room (priority 2)** until the first is confirmed.

The system ensures that all students have an opportunity to reserve rooms fairly, with real-time updates, payment-based confirmation, and email notifications.

- 🛏️ **Room Reservation Queue**
